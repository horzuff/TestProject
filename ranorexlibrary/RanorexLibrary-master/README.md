# RanorexLibrary
The RanorexLibrary offers an integration of the [Ranorex API](https://www.ranorex.com) into the [Robot Test Automation Framework](http://robotframework.org). This means, you can write Robot tests like you are used to, and use Ranorex functionality to automate GUIs independent of the underlying technology.

You can find a full documentation about the RanorexLibrary and how to use it in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Thomas-Gruber-90/RanorexLibrary/wiki).

**Please note:** You will still need valid Ranorex licenses to run the tests.
