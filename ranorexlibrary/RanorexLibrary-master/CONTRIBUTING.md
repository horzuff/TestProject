# Welcome!

Thank you for contributing to the RanorexLibrary.

If you have ideas or wishes for the RanorexLibrary, there are several ways how you could help:

- Open an issue
    - This helps immensely, especially if you find a bug. Please give all the detail that you have, so we can try to fix it as soon as possible.
- Make a pull request
    - If you know how the code can be improved, please feel free to make a pull request.
    - It is best to get in contact with the repository owners beforehand, for example by creating an issue, if you want to pull more than a quick bugfix, so the work can be coordinated.
- Do you have an idea for new keywords?
    - Open an issue, so we can discuss about it.

## Tell us about your project

We'd love to hear how you are using the RanorexLibrary, what you try to achieve with it, where your pain points are or if you need any help with it. The RanorexLibrary is far from finished, and we would love to tailor it the our users' needs, but in order to do so we have to get in contact with you. Don't be shy, we don't ~~byte~~ bite.
